## How to Run TypeScript

### 1. Install Node.js: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### 1. Install TypeScript: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```

### 3. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using

### 4. Compile TypeScript Files: Navigate to the directory containing the TypeScript files and compile them using:
```bash
tsc ./Practice1/task1.1.ts
```
### 5. Run the JavaScript File: You can execute the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:
```bash
node /Practice1/task1.1.js
```
### 6. Running TypeScript in Watch Mode
To automatically compile TypeScript files whenever changes are made, you can use the watch mode. This is especially useful during development. To run TypeScript in watch mode, use the following command:
```bash
tsc /Practice1/task1.1.ts --watch
```
This command will monitor the specified TypeScript file for any changes and recompile it automatically. Alternatively, you can use the tsconfig.json file to set up watch mode for an entire project. Simply run:
```bash
tsc --watch
```
